'subs' contains generally useful functions and classes. These will be
compiled into a library during installaion. Thus, for example, it includes 
random number generators, classes for times, dates, stellar positions and 
ephemerides and for program inputs, amongst other things. 

subs is a library package rather than a set of programs, but does come with
one program, 'weekday' which returns the day of the week corresponding to a 
date.
