'subs' is a library of general utility software used by many of my other
packages. 

Installation: subs is at the base level of my C++ packages and is the first
you should install. It requires third-party packages called 'pcre' (Perl
Compatible Regular Expressions), 'slalib' (C version) and 'pgplot'. Make sure
these are in place first. Pat Wallace allows me to send an obfusticated
version of slalib, but you will need to ask me for it.

If you download subs from github you will need first to configure it by 
running './bootstrap' then follow the instructions in INSTALL. The 
bootstrap step should not be necesssary if you start from the .tar.gz 
file.
