<h1>Basic subroutines and classes, Version ZzZzZ</h1>
<p>
This is the main page for documentation on generally useful
subroutines and classes written in C++. These are used by all my other C++
software and will be installed automatically if you install any of the
other stuff. Look here if you are interested in a class for command
line input, stellar positions, etc.
